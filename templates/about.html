        Thorin and Company were a group of thirteen Dwarves, the Wizard Gandalf, and the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins, led by Thorin
        II in TA 2941. Their purpose was to regain the lost Dwarven kingdom of the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II "Oakenshield", eventually called King under the Mountain or Mountain King, was the son of Thráin
                II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin
                was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to
                take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
                Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest
                of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.
